Welcome to my blog. I'm a father, husband, security engineer, and Star Trek enjoyer amongst other things. I started this blog because writing helps me remember and to help document some of my interests for my son and anyone else who's interested.

I may write about something very personal to me. But you may also come across the ten millionth post about ChatGPT. I won't claim to be an expert about anything, but if I learn something interesting I'll try to share it.

Thanks for stopping by.
