After about the 17th mistake using git at work, I decided to expand on the handful of incantations I've accumulated over the years to actually figure out what I am doing with git. After a quick search I found that the best source was the excellent docs on [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

After a few hours getting through the first few chapters on the basics and branches, I was surprised to realize that I knew more than I thought I did about what was going on. My biggest takeaway is that I need to be a little more intentional with the way I use git. The example work workflows in the book should help with that.

That still didn't stop me from messing up a rebase immediately after trying to clean up a few of my branches. But slow progress is better than no progress.
