This is for anyone needs to hear this: Your value is not defined by the by the code you write at work or your accomplishments. Your ideas don't have to always be the best. You are valuable and worth loving already.

Those words feel a little hollow at the moment. I have been waking up at odd hours unable to keep a few coding or other work-related things out of my head. So I'm writing this to remind myself and anyone else who needs to hear it.

Get your thoughts out of your head. Decompress and find another hobby to take your mind off of things. The break will make you more effective when you get back to work.
